<span id="g_t_0023context_002dand_002daim_002dof_002dthis_002dguide"></span><p>This document is intended to serve as a resource for instructors to
assist in the preparation of courses on C++ in a variety of settings,
including university, college, and industry environments. The main
objectives of this document are as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li> to provide guidelines for content to be covered by courses of various
difficulty levels on C++ (e.g., topics and learning outcomes)
</li><li> to note some common misunderstandings and problematic points that may be
encountered when teaching particular topics
</li><li> to suggest resources useful for teaching C++
</li><li> to present examples of curriculum for specific courses
</li></ul>

<p>This document does not itself provide a curriculum for a single specific
course, but is rather a set of guidelines that can be used to prepare
curricula for a wide variety of courses that differ in focus and level
of sophistication. (This said, however, some links to other documents
with examples of curricula for specific courses may be included herein.)
This document only intends to target the teaching of the most recently
ratified version of the C++ standard. (This said, however, since older
versions of this document are also available, these older versions may
be of some use to those who need guidance in older versions of the
standard, at least versions that do not predate C++20.)
