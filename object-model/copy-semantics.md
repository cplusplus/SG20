## Motivation

_Why is this important?_
_Why do we want to learn/teach this topic?_

Copy semantics allows the user to determine how objects of a class get replicated and interact on a value level.

## Topic introduction

_Very brief introduction to the topic._

Explains when and how objects are copied.

## Foundational knowledge: How and when are copies made

### Background/Required Knowledge

A student:
* knows what a type is?             [[C++ object model: types]][1]
* knows what an object is?          [[C++ object model: objects]][2], [[C++ object model: constant objects]][3]
* knows what class invariants are?

It helps when a student:
* knows move semantics              [[C++ object model: move semantics]][4]
* knows special member functions    [[C++ object model: special member functions]][5]

### Student outcomes

_A list of things "a student should be able to" after the curriculum._
_The next word should be an action word and testable in an exam._
_Max 5 items._

A student should be able to:

1. explain what copy semantics accomplish
  * establishing "equivalent" object state in another object
2. explain difference between deep and shallow copy
3. explain where copies are made

### Caveats

_This section mentions subtle points to understand, like anything resulting in
implementation-defined, unspecified, or undefined behavior._

* Compiler-provided (shallow) copies may result in ownership problems (e.g. `char*`).

### Points to cover

_This section lists important details for each point._

* Principle of copying
  * Copying of trivially copyable types
  * Copying of non-trivial class types
  * Copying an object does not change the original
* Copy Flavors
  * Shallow copy
  * No copy
  * Deep copy
* Practical applications
  * Unique_ptr  (no copy)
  * Strings (deep copy) 


## Advanced: Implementing user-defined copy operations

### Background/Required Knowledge

A student:
* knows special member functions  [[C++ object model: special member functions]][5]

It helps when a student:
* knows move semantics            [[C++ object model: move semantics]][4]
* knows the rule of five          [[C++ object model: rule-of-five]][6]
* knows the rule of zero          [[C++ object model: rule-of-zero]][7]

### Student outcomes

_A list of things "a student should be able to" after the curriculum._
_The next word should be an action word and testable in an exam._
_Max 5 items._

A student should be able to:
* explain when they have to implement the copy operations for their own type
  * Copy constructor
  * Copy assignment operator
* implement copy operations for their own types
* _Optional_: explain when copying with basic and strong exception guarantees is useful.

### Caveats

_This section mentions subtle points to understand, like anything resulting in
implementation-defined, unspecified, or undefined behavior._

* Intricacies when implementing copy operations:
  * Examples of how _not_ to write copy operations (e.g. `std::auto_ptr`)

### Points to cover

_This section lists important details for each point._

* Copy constructors and copy assignment operators
  * How compiler generates default copy operations
  * =default, =delete (No copy)
  * How-to write your own copy operations
  * Rule-of-five
  * Copy assignment operators can be ref-qualified to avoid assigning into temporary objects. (See example #1)

## Further studies

_These are not expected to be covered but provide guidance where one can
continue to investigate this topic in more depth._

When can copies be elided and when does the standard guarantee copy elision.
