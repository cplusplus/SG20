<span id="g_t_0023organization_002dof_002dthis_002ddocument"></span><p>The various concepts (i.e., ideas) to potentially be covered are
partitioned into modules. A module is very broad in scope and consists
of numerous topics. <strong>[Note: Can I suggest that we use the term
&ldquo;area&rdquo; or &ldquo;unit&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;module&rdquo;? I think that these other
choices are better and also avoid any potential confusion over what is
meant by &ldquo;module&rdquo; (i.e., C++ term versus plain English term).]</strong>
</p>
<p>For each module, topics related to the module are identified. Then, for
each topic, learning outcomes are specified. In order to address a wide
variety of courses on C++, each topic is addressed at three proficiency
levels. These proficiency levels allow each topic to be covered at more
than one level of detail. This allows target audiences with different
background and learning objectives to be accommodated. The three
proficiency levels are as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li> foundational. This level gives the learner the idea that a facility
exists, what benefits it offers, and the basic ways of using it.
<strong>[Note: Isn&rsquo;t this just &ldquo;novice&rdquo;/&ldquo;beginner&rdquo;?]</strong>

</li><li> main. This level shows mainstream uses and techniques. For abstraction
and organizational mechanisms it also demonstrates how to build them.
This level should also give the learner a basic (but not detailed)
understanding of how a facility might be implemented so that the learner
can have a first-order understanding of any costs involved.
<strong>[Note: The term &ldquo;main&rdquo; is not very descriptive/helpful. Could
I suggest using &ldquo;intermediate&rdquo;?]</strong>

</li><li> advanced. This level gives information suitable for an expert. For most
topics there is an expert level of knowledge that most programmers
rarely need and techniques that require detailed understanding of
language rules or library implementation.

</li></ul>

<p>The remainder of this document is organized as follows. The various
topics are listed grouped by module. In cases where a topic might be
classified into more than one module, the topic is listed under the
module of most direct relevance. This is done in order to avoid
duplication of content. (In the case that a topic is equally relevant to
multiple modules, the decision of which to select is made by a
proverbial coin toss.) The order in which modules and topics are
presented is not meant to imply any order of coverage in a course. The
order in which items are listed is essentially arbitrary.
