## Copy Elision and Implicit Moving {#copy_elision}

### Basic Learning Outcomes {#copy_elision-basic}

### Intermediate Learning Outcomes {#copy_elision-intermediate}

After completing this unit, the student should be able to:

- explain what copy elision and implicit moving are
  and why they are beneficial;

- explain what is meant by return value optimization (RVO)
  and named RVO (NRVO);

- for certain common code patterns, be able identify whether copy, move, or
  copy elision takes place.

### Advanced Learning Outcomes {#copy_elision-advanced}

After completing this unit, the student should be able to:

- identify the particular circumstances when copy
  elision is permitted (but not necessarily required)
  and when it is required;

- in arbitrary code, be able to identify whether copy, move, or copy
  elision takes place.

### Common Misunderstandings

Some common misunderstandings include the following:

- Copy elision is only relevant to construction not assignment.
