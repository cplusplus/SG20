# Summary of Modules/Areas and Topics

In the sections that follow, the various modules/areas and topics
are presented.
There is one section per module/area.
For each module/area, a table listing the various topics in that module/area
is provided.
The ID for a module/area is linked to the detailed coverage of that
module/area that comes later in the document.
In the table, a checkmark indicates that learning outcomes exist for the
specific proficiency level.
A dash indicates that no learning outcomes exist for the specific
proficiency level (simply because there
are not any, not because the information is missing).
In the case that the information for a knowledge unit is completely
missing, a "‚ùå" symbol is used.

[**NOTE**: These topics are taken mostly from the SG20 GitHub repository.
They are not intended to be complete in any sense.
In fact, by gathering together all topics in one place where they are
easily viewed, it is hoped that missing and unbalanced items will be more
obvious.]
